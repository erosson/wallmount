I attached an old Android tablet to a wall (2012 Nexus 7). It displays this webpage all day. All of this information's available in other places, but it's nice to be able to see all of it just by turning my head, zero clicks.

I'm not planning to support this page for anyone but me.

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.12.1.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview. `grunt deploy` pushes to the gh-pages branch displayed by the tablet.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
